# macOS EDR Deployment

What It Does

* EndpointSecurity Framework (ESF) - Blocks unsigned code execution and monitors file modifications
* SIP Enforcement - Ensures kernel/extensions can't be modified even by root
* Unified Logging - Centralizes security events for SIEM integration

Why It Matters

* Apple’s built-in security only covers App Store apps
* Stops macOS-specific threats like:
   * Silver Sparrow (M1 malware)
   * XCSSET (Xcode supply-chain attacks)
* Complies with macOS security benchmarks (CIS Level 1)

Key Protection Against:

* Adware bundles (e.g., Pirrit, Shlayer)
* Office macro-based attacks
* Time Machine backup tampering

## Overview code

Production-ready script for deploying:
- EndpointSecurity Framework (ESF) rules
- System audit logging
- LaunchDaemon persistence

## Requirements

- macOS ≥ 10.15 (Catalina)
- Root privileges
- SIP configured with `--with kext --with dtrace`

## Critical warnings !!!

1. **SIP Configuration**:
   - Must be done manually in Recovery Mode
   - Script will verify but not automate this step

2. **ESF Rules**:
   - Default config blocks all unsigned executables
   - Test rules in "notify" mode before "deny"

## Usage

1. First configure SIP in Recovery Mode:

```bash
csrutil enable --with kext --with dtrace
```

2. Then run:

```bash
chmod +x macos_edr.sh
sudo ./macos_edr.sh
```

## Verification

```bash
# Check ESF logger
sudo launchctl list | grep com.company.edr

# View logs
tail -f /var/log/edr_audit.log
```

## Removal

```bash
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.company.edr.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.company.edr.plist
```

## Key production features

1. **Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Pre-flight checks for prerequisites
   - Automatic backups before modifications
   - Idempotent configuration changes

2. **Enterprise Readiness**:
   - Systemd services (Linux) and LaunchDaemons (macOS)
   - Rate limiting on resource-intensive operations
   - Journald integration for log rotation

3. **Documentation**:
   - Explicit warnings in READMEs
   - Recovery procedures for rollback
   - Verification steps post-deployment

## To deploy in production

1. Review all variables in the scripts
2. Test in staging environment
3. Deploy via configuration management (Ansible/Chef) for large-scale deployments
